In case of trying to fix the code virtually:

To find the top of the arm:
1. Open Rev's software
2. Turn on the robot with the arm at the bottom starting position
3. Manually move the arm to the highest point
4. In Rev's software, find the motor that is for the arm and read the encoder value
5. Change ARM_TOP_LIMIT to the encoder value

Finding the height of each scoring positon
1. Copy the same steps from the previous instructions
2. Instead of moving the arm to the highest point, instead move it to the correct position to score
4. In Rev's software, find the motor that is for the arm and read the encoder value
3. Change the corresponding constant in Constants (L1_HEIGHT, L2_HEIGHT, L3_HEIGHT, STOW_HEIGHT)

Tuning PID for drive and arm
1. Run the Tuning Auto which will go from the wall of the driver station to against the reef
2. If the robot went too far, lower DRIVE_P by a very small amount and try again
If the robot did not go far enough, raise DRIVE_P by a very small amount and try again
3. Run until the robot goes the correct distance.

For arm PID
1. Set ARM_P, ARM_I, ARM_D to 0
2. Enable the robot in teleop
3. Press the button to go to L2
4. Raise P until the arm starts oscillating constantly
5. Start raising D until it smoothly goes from Stow to L2 without overshooting
